## Introduction
Tourism, a trillion-dollar industry, significantly impacts global GDP and constitutes about 7% of all exports, driving socio-economic development worldwide. However, it also contributes over 8% of global GHG emissions, with emissions rising annually (WTTC, 2023). Malaysia, a top tourist destination, sees tourism as a key economic driver, contributing RM 102 billion to GDP and creating 3.562 million jobs in 2019 (MOTAC, 2020). Emphasizing sustainable tourism, Malaysia's National Tourism Policy (NTP) aligns with the UN SDGs. Effective, cost-efficient data collection and analysis are crucial for monitoring tourism sustainability, bridging the gap between theory and practice (Hoffmann et al., 2022). 


## Problem Statement
- Rising environmental concerns in tourism emphasize the need for sustainable practices in accommodations, requiring a solid understanding of metrics and effective data-driven decision-making.
- The lack of precise data in Malaysia's accommodations sector is hindering the progress of sustainable tourism. It also hampers tourists' environmentally responsible choices and deprives providers and policymakers of crucial insights.


## Objective
- To develop and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques on data from an OTA platform to accurately classify tourist accommodations as sustainable, as indicated by the presence of a sustainability label

## Data Source
- Data was meticulously gathered from the OTA platform Booking.com, resulting in a rich dataset comprising 40 raw features across 17,866 samples. Features are systematically categorized into seven distinct sections: About (A), Room & Price (RP), Review (R), Host (H), Surroundings (SR), Facilities (F), and Sustainability (S). 


## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** The Web-scraped data navigated to the overview section, extracting data from 25 accommodations per page and delving into each to capture 40 features. This process repeated through 40 pages, yielding 1000 accommodations per location. Covering 16 states and the federal territory of Malaysia.
